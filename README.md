## About This Project

This is E-Commerce dashboard web application  designed to provide real-time insights into an online storeâ€™s operations. It enables store owners and managers to track sales, monitor inventory, and understand customer behavior through interactive data visualizations.

Outlines:
- The application is responsive, which means that you can use it on your computer and phone without losing any details.
- It's built on both dark and light themes, which allow you to switch between them whenever you want.
- This application is designed as SPA(Single Page Application) with Laravel and Livewire. This means that the application is faster to load and more user-friendly.
- The application is highly secured, which means that it's only accessible to authorized users.

## Libraries that we used in this project

- We used [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/) Which is an open-source admin panel written in PHP, built on top of the popular Laravel framework. Its primary focus is to bring ease of use to developers. Filament leverages Livewire, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS for the front-end part.
